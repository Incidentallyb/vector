You have been making some very difficult decisions so far, and your experiments are starting to show results.

[cCc]
In order to keep the balance of success vs harm, we have a few options for you, each will affect your success and harm rating.

(To keep the balance of success vs harm, we have a few options for you, each will affect your success and harm rating.)

Would you like to:

Scale up your work by doing more experiments involving more animals now. It will involve more harm, but you could get results faster. Cost: £2,000,000

Set up some more experiments in a phased way so that you learn from each experiment as you go. It could reduce harm, but it would take longer to get results. Cost: £1,000,000

Collaborate with a Biocore competitor so that you can share both your past data and biomatter. It would reduce harm, but you would lose some economic benefits. Cost: £3,000,000
