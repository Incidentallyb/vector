We are almost at the end of the simulation. You are doing very well and your experiments are making results. There are a few more things we can do to affect the harm and success ratings.

You can choose two to employ in your experiments. 

Training £1,000,000
We can spend some time and resources training the animals so they feel more comfortable with the equipment, procedures and environment where the experiments will take place. Allowing them to see the lab as their home and to see the experiments as normal procedures will decrease their distress. 

Rehousing after the experiment £1,000,000 
Many of the animals that are used during the experiment cannot be released back into the wild. Some have been genetically engineered and cannot be allowed back into the eco systems. Others have never been in a wild environment and will not survive. Most animals are destroyed after the experiment has been completed and their material sent to Bio Banks.

Animals that remain unused in the experiment may be able to be rehoused as pets or more often in sanctuaries. 

Helping validate alternatives £1,000,000
The data from your animal experiments can be used to develop and validate the alternatives to animal testing. This might help regulators know which alternatives work best. 

Making all your data available £1,000,000
You can Make your data available for other people to analyze and use in their research, this includes data from the experiments that didn’t give you the results you expected or wanted. This might help other researchers use less animals. 

Publishing on animal welfare £1,000,000
If you collect and publish the data you have on any animal suffering in the experiments you carried out, it might help other people make refinements to their experiments in the future. 

Cage Conditions £1,000,000
We can make the animals more comfortable in their cages by adding toys and stimulating objects.

Do Nothing £0,000,000
