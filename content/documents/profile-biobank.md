# BioBank

-	The storage of organs or tissues from animals used in research is becoming more popular amongst the scientific community.
-	It is seen as a way to decrease the harm of their current experiments as the individual does not have to be wasted, but instead used in other experiments. 
-	The experiments that can be conducted on the material will be limited and it is not possible to observe the effect on a complex, full living organism.
-	This is still a new field and results may not be immediately found until new experimental models can be developed and tested. 
-	Stats and scores will depend on the type of biomatter.
