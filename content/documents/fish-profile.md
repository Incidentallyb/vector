- The first scientific study of zebrafish began nearly 40 years ago, but it has been in the past 10 that the use of zebrafish in research has boomed.
- They are easy to care for and cost-effective. More importantly, they offer biological advantages that other research models cannot match.
- The cell physiology of a zebrafish is similar to that of humans, making the fish a suitable model for many human diseases.
- The first cell division in the zebrafish embryo occurs within 45 minutes of fertilisation, so scientists can observe the effect of adding or deleting genes at the one-cell stage.
- Using the embryos can minimise the ethical effect of experimenting on the animal, and some would even dispute whether a newly hatched embryo not yet capable of independent feeding should be regarded as an animal at all. However many people regard embryos as living beings, so the discussion continues.
- A zebrafish will lay 100-500 eggs every week, and once fertilised, the eggs waste no time in hatching and the animal is self sustaining, not requiring food for the first 5 days or so.
