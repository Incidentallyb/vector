- The biology of a Macaque is similar to a humans - especially in relation to brain function and disease, reproduction and susceptibility to certain infections.
- Non-human primates are the closest species to humans in terms of biological make-up, so they have a high degree of sentience, and a greater level of harm when conducting experiments is assumed.
- Housing primates such as Macaques is expensive and resource heavy. They require large amounts of space and are costly to breed and replace.
