# Pig

-	Pigs are preferred for this research for a number of reasons, including the size of their organs and the fact there is a long history of using genetic modification with this species.
-	Pigs are highly intelligent and social animals, and have been used in research for centuries.
-	However, owing to their high intelligence, they have a high level of sentience and it could be argued that research using them can be regarded as inflicting a high level of harm. 
-	As a larger species, pigs require more space in the animal house, they also need to be housed together as they do not respond well to being alone.
-	Handling pigs requires more staff and more staff time. They do eat a lot of food and the economic cost will increase again.
