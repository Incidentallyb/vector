# Mice

-	Most of the mice used in medical trials are inbred so that, other than sex differences, they are almost identical genetically. This helps make the results of medical trials more uniform. 
-	Another reason rodents are used as models in medical testing is that their genetic, biological and behaviour characteristics closely resemble those of humans
-	Mice are seen as a less ethically difficult animal to use in experiments compared to other high sentience animals.
-	Surplus mice have to be culled. Rodents are almost never rehoused and the biomatter is not generally stored as the animals are so easily bred.
-	Rodents are small, easily housed and maintained, and adapt well to new surroundings.
-	They also reproduce quickly and have a short lifespan of two to three years, so several generations of mice can be observed in a relatively short period of time
