Hello All,

It’s Charlie again; there’s been some developments with the staffing of the experiment. The technicians have begun to demonstrate a level of attachment to the animals which is affecting their stress levels during their shifts, as well as their attitude towards the experiment. As a result, we’ve also had a bit of a turnover of staff. This could be managed by eliminating non essential contact time with the pigs and doing some swapping around of the rotas. Pigs are really social animals, and do enjoy human contact, however they’re more than happy to hang out with each other, so if we do reduce their contact time with the technicians it won’t affect their wellbeing, but it will definitely help those taking care of them.

To limit the time the staff spend with the pigs will cost us £1,000,000 as we will have to hire new staff, and the change model it will cost us £2,000,000

Let me know what you think!

Thanks,

Charlie
