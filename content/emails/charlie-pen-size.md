Good afternoon,

I don’t think we’ve met yet! I’m Charlie, the Lab Technician on this experiment - I take care of the animals on a day to day basis, feeding them, keeping note of their behaviour and making sure that they are well and happy. The experiment is going really well, however I am concerned that the pigs don’t have enough space in their current housing. They are showing some signs of stress as their movement is limited.

I think it would be worth increasing the size of their pens; now I know that this is a costly option and we have limited resources, but I really believe that this would provide a much better environment for them. And as we know, unhappy pigs make for poor data; better welfare equals better science. The larger pens will cost us £3,000,000

Let me know what you think,

Thanks,

Charlie
