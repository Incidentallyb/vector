Hi Everyone,

The new batch of samples were much better quality.

It gives me great pleasure to inform you that we have discovered a major breakthrough in vaccine development. This is a result of the complex and sometimes challenging decisions you have had to make.

As a result of this breakthrough we must push ahead to the next stage of trials and begin testing on more complex living organisms. It is intended this will use a small sample size and I am fully confident in my team’s ability to further progress our research. A decision must be made as to which organism will be selected for testing - Pigs, Mice or Fish. Each have their own merits and I would encourage you to once again pursue a results driven approach for the benefit of progress.

As we only need a small sample size, the cost will only be £1,000,000. The harm rate will also be lower than usual

I await your response.

Many Thanks,

Dr. Barry Taylor
