Hi Team, 

Unfortunately we had a major break in last night and there has been a significant amount of damage to our equipment. All of our kit and computers have been destroyed, and the samples have been taken. Luckily, we still have back ups of the data, so at least that is safe. 

The good news is that the culprits have been caught - they were working with a pro-life group who objected to the experiment on religious grounds. 

The first thing we need to do is re-build which is going to cost us Â£5,000,000, but we also need to decide how we want to engage with the culprit. We can prosecute them and try to recoup our money through the courts - or we can engage the group in conversation and maybe develop a new public engagement project. This might help them and similar groups understand more about stem cell research and future proof our experiments. The latter is a bold move, but it might decrease our harm, as it raises public awareness of the issues surrounding our research.

Let me know what you think,

Jenny
