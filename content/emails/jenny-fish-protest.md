Hello,

It’s Jenny from the PR department; we’re encountering a lot of bad press and protest activity across social media, due to the use of fish embryos as our animal model for the development of the vaccine. We’re getting significant activity from @AllLifeIsScared in particular, and there are rumours of a large scale pro-life protest planned outside the facility next week. Do not directly engage with or respond personally to any approaches from protestors; please refer any enquiries to the PR office. The facility is upping security measures to make sure the building is safe, and it is vital that you let us know if you receive any correspondence from the protest group; we have procedures in place should you or your family feel threatened.

I would recommend rethinking the animal model, at a cost of £2,000,00 or press ahead if you want to. The extra security will also cost us £3,000,000

Do let me know either way, and I’ll start thinking about the best way to handle the situation.

Many thanks,

Jenny
