Dear Team,

We have not had a chance to meet yet, I am Dr. Barry Taylor, the Principal Investigator for this research. It is my job to drive the science forward and achieve the best possible research outcomes. I have some important news about the model you have selected.

To know how the vaccine works we need to show it stops the mice getting sick, or significantly reduces their symptoms, increases survival, and reduces recovery times. This is the “challenge phase” in your protocol document. To do this reliably we need to work out how much virus to give the mice. We have tried several doses, but the mice are not susceptible to this virus!

This has been observed before and there could be many reasons for this. However, this means the strain of mice we use at Biocore are not a suitable model for this research. Given the time and budgets pressures I insist we switch to either macaques or fish. The change will cost us £2,000,000

Please let me know your decisions as soon as possible.

Regards

Dr. Barry Taylor
