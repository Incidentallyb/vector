Hello,

It’s Jenny from the PR department; we’re encountering a lot of bad press and protest activity across social media, due to the use of Human Stem Cells as our model for the development of the immunisation. We’re getting significant activity from @AllLifeIsSacred in particular, and there are rumours of a large scale Pro Life protest planned outside the facility next week. The facility is upping security measures to make sure the building is safe, and it is vital that you let us know if you receive any correspondence from the protest group; we have procedures in place should you or your family feel threatened.

I would recommend rethinking the animal model, which will cost us £2,000,000 or press ahead if you want to but we will have to pay for extra security at £3,000,000. Do let me know either way, and I’ll start thinking about the best way to handle the situation.

Many Thanks,

Jenny
