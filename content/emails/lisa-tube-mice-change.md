Good afternoon,
 
I don’t think we’ve met yet. I’m Dr. Lisa Finnamore, the Named Veterinary Surgeon in this facility. I’m responsible for ensuring that the welfare of the animals remains within legal standards. I know it sounds grand but should the activities in the experiment compromise the welfare of the animals, I have the ability to stop it straight away. Just to let you know!
During my routine inspection, the animal technicians reported that the mice are showing signs of stress (increased heart rate and repetitive movement) when being routinely handled for observation and asked for my advice. We talked through some options to enrich the cage environment and reduce the stress of handling. These could include:
 
Option one - tubes and toys. Switching from manual handling to using plastic observation tubes has shown to increase welfare standards by reducing stress. Adding toys, such as fibre pads and chew sticks also provides additional stimulation and encourages natural behaviour which is all great for welfare. However, some people were concerned all this extra “stuff” in the cages will make daily observations harder and increase their workload. Which brings me to option two.
 
Option two - tubes and toys and increase cage size. I know this would be a significant financial investment, but the extra cage size would allow for more enrichment and make observation and handling easier. We could trial the new size just for this study before rolling out across other work packets.
 
Option three - as always, you can choose not to take any action at this time.
I’m looking forward to hearing how you would like to move forward,
Many thanks,
Dr. Lisa Finnamore
