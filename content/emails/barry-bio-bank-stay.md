Hello, 

I am afraid my misgivings were correct. This material is unusable, and the quality is not to the standard required to perform the types of experiments we need to conduct!

It is not consistent, and sometimes we are having false positives, which is killing the morale of my team, and I feel this is all down to the material we are using. 

I feel that we don’t have the technology to make this a viable option, yet. You never know, we might be the ones to find a new and successful way of using this matter. We can get another set of samples in for another £5,000,000

I request again, can we consider moving to a different model? As before, this will cost us £2,000,000

I await your response

Dr. Barry Taylor
