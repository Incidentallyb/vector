Hello All,

Please see an email from one of my colleagues - I received this earlier today and wanted to let you know the current situation in the lab. Jamie is interning with us on a university placement and is quite distressed : 

“I am becoming increasingly uncomfortable working with Macaques as a selected animal model. When I came to work for BioCore I didn’t realise that this would be the model in use and the reality of working in this way has really shocked me and I haven’t really felt able to discuss this with anyone in our professional environment.  Historically we've moved away from Macaques because of their higher sentience and I feel that the use of Macaques in this context is a real step backwards for both myself personally and the wider scientific community. With this in mind I would like to tender my resignation with immediate effect.” 

I think it would be a real shame to lose Jamie, and also not great for our reputation. We would also have to spend additional time and resource training a replacement etc. 

Thanks,

Charlie
