Dear Team Oak, 
 
We have not had a chance to meet yet, I am Dr. Barry Taylor, the Principal Investigator for this research. It is my job to drive the science forward and achieve the best possible research outcomes. I have some important news about the model you have selected. 
 
To know how the vaccine works we need to show it stops the mice getting sick, or significantly reduces their symptoms, increases survival, and reduces recovery times. This is the “challenge phase” in your protocol document. To do this reliably we need to work out how much virus to give the mice. We have tried several doses, but the mice are not susceptible to this virus!
 
This has been observed before and there could be many reasons for this. Viruses need to lock on to a cell before it can enter. It does this by attaching to something called a receptor. Research just published suggests that mice cells do not express the receptor this virus needs. 
 
However, we can genetically engineer mice that do express this receptor. There are two options to consider.
 
Option one; engineer these mice ourselves at Biocore. We do have the capabilities, but it will put additional strain on staff and we cover all the costs. However, it means the mice do not have to be transported and we have control over who has access to them. This will cost £5,000,000
 
Option two; contract a commercial supplier to make and ship them to us. This means we can maintain or current breeding stocks for other experiments, but it will involve shipping materials. This will cost us £2,000,000
 
Please let me know your decisions as soon as possible.
Regards
Dr. Barry Taylor
