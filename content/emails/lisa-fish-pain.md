Hello, 

I don’t think we’ve met yet, I’m Dr Lisa Finnamore, the named veterinary surgeon in this facility, I’m responsible for ensuring that the welfare of the animals remains within legal standards. My main concern is the wellbeing of the animals within the lab and I will stop the experiment if I feel the animals are under too much distress. 

I wanted to contact you about some new research one of my team has brought to me regarding our understanding of the way fish experience pain. We used to believe that fish did not experience pain. Evidence suggests that fish can sense potentially harmful environmental changes, such as high temperatures, intense pressure, and caustic chemicals, but that they do not feel and react to pain in the same way that mammals do. However, it has now become apparent that fish are showing signs of distress and abnormal behavior when placed in painful conditions, which, quite frankly, is not surprising behavior for a sentient life form if you ask me! 

I request that we go for a different approach. Dr Taylor showed some interest in changing to fish embryos. I think, in light of this new research, we should consider this and change the model to fish embryos. This will cost us £3,000,000.
 
I’m looking forward to hearing how you would like to move forward,

Many thanks,

Dr Lisa Finnamore
