Hello,

My name is Dr. Barry Taylor and I am the Principal Investigator at BioCore. My job is to ensure that the experiment stays on track and that we keep to the decisions you have made. The science is my main concern, and I want to find the vaccine to this disease.

I had my misgivings about using biobanks as I do like to make my own samples from the animals, as I then know that the sample is prepared under controlled conditions to a good standard.

I do not think that this material will work for us, but I understand the reason for choosing to use this material. If you would like to continue to use the Bio Bank model, we would need to get a new batch of samples costing us £5,000,000

If possible, can we consider changing to a different animal model? I would suggest fish as they are not considered sentient and therefore, the harm rating should be lower than the other species. This will cost us £2,000,000 to change model

I, of course, am happy to be led by your decision I am confident my team can find the vaccine.

I await your response,

Dr. Barry Taylor
