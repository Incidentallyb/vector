Hello All,

I’m Charlie, the Lab Technician on this experiment - I take care of the animals on a day to day basis, feeding them, keeping note of their behaviour and making sure that they are well and happy. The experiment is going really well, however there’s been some developments with the staffing. The technicians have become increasingly stressed during their shifts due to the distress the mice are experiencing during observation. 

There are a couple of options here; this could be managed by swapping the technicians shifts around to try and limit their contact time with the mice, which will cost us £3,000,000 by getting more staff in, or we could think about changing the animal model wich will cost us £2,000,000 Let me know what you think! 

Thanks,

Charlie
