Hi Everyone,

This has been an absolute disaster!

The public doesn't believe that we are doing the best we can do for the Macaques in the experiment and are asking some really difficult questions. They think we are monsters as they do not know what it is we are doing in our labs.

To make matters worse, our investors are starting to pull out, meaning we will loose a large proportion of our funding.

We need to release a statement. I am happy to draft this, but I need to know which direction you would like me to go.

We can release a press release letting the public know how we are treating the Macaques and be transparent about our procedures. This will definitely have an impact on our harm as it will help the population to understand us, but the investors are likely to stay away.

We could also contact our investors and re-assure them that we are still a good investment, which will increase our cash flow, but will increase our harm.

Let me know what you would like to do

Many Thanks

Jenny
