Dear Team,

Thanks for all of your contributions so far. Unfortunately, due to the complex situation with our departure from the European Union, we have been informed by our supplier in Mauritius that they are no longer able to export the particular kind of macaque monkey we have been using to the UK. 

Whilst the research undertaken so far has been very valuable, we need you to reconsider the animal model we’re currently using. Once you’ve made your decision, just let Al know. As before, the cost to change the model will be £2,000,000

Thanks,

Jenny
