Good afternoon,

I don’t think we’ve met yet. I’m Dr. Lisa Finnamore, the Named Veterinary Surgeon in this facility. I’m responsible for ensuring that the welfare of the animals remains within legal standards. I know it sounds grand, but should the activities in the experiment compromise the welfare of the animals, I have the ability to stop it straight away. Just to let you know!

I’m getting in touch as the technicians have reported that the mice are showing signs of stress (increased heart rate and repetitive movement) when being routinely handled for observation; the solution is to introduce the use of observation tubes - this is standard practice in some facilities now. This means that we would train the mice to enter a plastic tube; the technician will then be able to observe the mice through the tube without having to handle them at all. This will cost us £3,000,00

This does have an economic impact, as we will need to invest in the tubes and spend time training the mice as well as purchasing the specialist cleaning equipment needed to ensure that the tubes are fully sterilised. It may also limit the quality of observation undertaken by the technicians.

I’m looking forward to hearing how you would like to move forward,

Many thanks,

Dr. Lisa Finnamore
