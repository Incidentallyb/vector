Good afternoon Team,

I don’t think we’ve met yet. I’m Dr. Lisa Finnamore, the Named Veterinary Surgeon in this facility. I’m responsible for ensuring that the welfare of the animals remains within legal standards. I know it sounds grand but should the activities in the experiment compromise the welfare of the animals, I have the ability to stop it straight away. Just to let you know!

I have some important news about the model you have selected.

To know how the vaccine works we need to show it stops the mice getting sick, or significantly reduces their symptoms, increases survival, and reduces recovery times. This is the “challenge phase” in your protocol document. To do this reliably we need to work out how much virus to give the mice. We have tried several doses, but even at extremely low doses of this virus the mice become very sick and must be euthanised.

The mice will not live long enough to test if the vaccine works and to continue using this model will likely breach severity standards set out in the legislation and we risk being investigated by the Home Office.

I understand there are considerable time and budget pressures but for welfare reasons you need to select a new animal model. I suggest switching to either pigs or biobank stem cells. I have sent you some additional documentation to help with this decision. To change to Pigs it will cost us £2,000,000 or to change to stem cells/biobank models will cost a little more at £4,000,000

Thank you for understanding and I am sure you will continue to make good ethical choices.

Regards
Dr. Lisa Finnamore
