Hello,

My name is Dr Barry Taylor and I am the Principal Investigator at BioCore. My job is to ensure that the experiment stays on track and that we keep to the decisions you have made. The science is my main concern and I want to find the vaccine to this disease.

Though I appreciate the decision taken to move toward mice observation through plastic tubes; myself and the team are encountering difficulties with this approach. While the comfort of the subjects themselves has improved, our abilities to monitor and physically examine the mice, and to effectively conduct trials, has suffered. Evidence from some previous studies suggests that this approach will decrease our chances of developing a vaccine. 

I, of course, am happy to be led by your decision, but I would like to request that we alter our approach to trials and use fish or pigs to achieve better results. Changing the animal model will cost us Â£2,000,000

I await your response.

Many thanks,

Dr. Barry Taylor
