Hello,

My name is Dr. Barry Taylor and I am the Principal Investigator at BioCore. My role is to ensure that the experiment stays on track and that we keep to the decisions you have made which is why it gives me great pleasure to inform you that we have discovered a major breakthrough in vaccine development. This is a result of the complex and sometimes challenging decisions you have had to make.

As a result of this breakthrough we must push ahead to the next stage of trials and begin testing on more complex living organisms. It is intended this will use a small sample size and I am fully confident in my team’s ability to further progress our research. A decision must be made as to which organism will be selected for testing - Pigs, Mice or Fish. Each have their own merits and I would encourage you to once again pursue a results driven approach for the benefit of progress.

As we only need a small sample size it will only cost us £1,000,000 and the harm rating will be lower than usual

I await your response.

Many Thanks,

Dr. Barry Taylor
