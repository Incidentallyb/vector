1.4 Fish

AL: Are you sure you would like to use a Fish Model?

YES


AL: Fish are a new animal model which is really promising as an alternative to other models. Hopefully, we can get some great results

DR BARRY TAYLOR EMAIL:

BT: Hello,

My name is Dr Barry Taylor and I am the Principal Investigator at BioCore. My job is to ensure that the experiment stays on track and that we keep to the decisions you have made. The science is my main concern and I want to find the vaccine for this disease.

I have found some really interesting research which suggests there is a different way we can use the fish in this experiment. One of the great attributes of zebrafish is that the embryonic matter is transparent, allowing us to see the cells developing or even observe the interactions of the virus and the proteins inside the cells themselves! This is terribly exciting! This will cost us £3,000,000 to change over.

If we go along this direction, we might be able to decrease our harm rating. However, it might not yield the results we need. I am confident that my team can get it done either way. 

Let me know how you would like to move forward.

Many thanks,

Dr Barry Taylor

JC:  Hello, 

It’s Jenny from the PR department; we’re encountering a lot of bad press and protest activity across social media, due to the use of fish embryos as our animal model for the development of the vaccine. We’re getting significant activity from @AllLifeIsScared in particular, and there are rumours of a large scale pro-life protest planned outside the facility next week. Do not directly engage with or respond personally to any approaches from protestors; please refer any enquiries to the PR office. The facility is upping security measures to make sure the building is safe, and it is vital that you let us know if you receive any correspondence from the protest group; we have procedures in place should you or your family feel threatened. 
 
I would recommend rethinking the animal model, at a cost of £2,000,00 or press ahead if you want to. The extra security will also cost us £3,000,000

Do let me know either way, and I’ll start thinking about the best way to handle the situation. 

Many thanks,

1.5 Bio Matter


AL: Biomatter is very experimental, and there are a few options for you to have a look at. I have sent you some documents regarding human embryonic stem cells and biobank material. Let me know when you have made a choice.

Which option would you like to use?

1.5.1 Bio Bank

AL: Are you Sure you would like to use Bio Banks?

YES

Using material from other experiments is a great way of decreasing overall harm of the experiment.

DR BARRY TAYLOR

BT: I am having problems using the biobank samples. I have sent you an email

BT: Hello,

My name is Dr Barry Taylor and I am the Principal Investigator at BioCore. My job is to ensure that the experiment stays on track and that we keep to the decisions you have made. The science is my main concern, and I want to find the vaccine to this disease.

I had my misgivings about using biobanks as I do like to make my own samples from the animals, as I then know that the sample is prepared under controlled conditions to a good standard.

I do not think that this material will work for us, but I understand the reason for choosing to use this material. If you would like to continue to use the Bio Bank model, we would need to get a new batch of samples costing us £5,000,000

If possible, can we consider changing to a different animal model? I would suggest fish as they are not considered sentient and therefore, the harm rating should be lower than the other species. This will cost us £2,000,00 to change model

I, of course, am happy to be led by your decision I am confident my team can find the vaccine.

I await your response,

Dr Barry Taylor

BT: Hello, 

I am afraid my misgivings were correct. This material is unusable, and the quality is not to the standard required to perform the types of experiments we need to conduct!

It is not consistent, and sometimes we are having false positives, which is killing the moral of my team, and I feel this is all down to the material we are using. 

I feel that we don’t have the technology to make this a viable option, yet. You never know, we might be the ones to find a new and successful way of using this matter. We can get another set of samples in for another £5,000,000

I request again, can we consider moving to a different model? As before, this will cost us £2,000,000

I await your response

BT: Hi Guys,

The new batch of samples were much better quality.

It gives me great pleasure to inform you that we have discovered a major breakthrough in vaccine development. This is a result of the complex and sometimes challenging decisions you have had to make. 

As a result of this breakthrough we must push ahead to the next stage of trials and begin testing on more complex living organisms. It is intended this will use a small sample size and I am fully confident in my team’s ability to further progress our research. A decision must be made as to which organism will be selected for testing - Pigs, Mice or Fish. Each have their own merits and I would encourage you to once again pursue a results driven approach for the benefit of progress. 

As we only need a small sample size, the cost will only be £1,000,000. The harm rate will also be lower than usual

I await your response. 

Many Thanks,

JC: We have some protesters gathering outside the lab.....

Hello, 

It’s Jenny from the PR department; we’re encountering a lot of bad press and protest activity across social media, due to the use of Human Stem Cells as our model for the development of the immunisation. We’re getting significant activity from @AllLifeIsSacred in particular, and there are rumours of a large scale Pro Life protest planned outside the facility next week. The facility is upping security measures to make sure the building is safe, and it is vital that you let us know if you receive any correspondence from the protest group; we have procedures in place should you or your family feel threatened. 
 
I would recommend rethinking the animal model, which will cost us £2,000,000 or press ahead if you want to but we will have to pay for extra security at £3,000,000. Do let me know either way, and I’ll start thinking about the best way to handle the situation. 

Many Thanks,

Lets stay on course with Stem Cells

FILE-emails: stay.md

JC: I have some more bad news........

JC:  Hi Team, 

Unfortunately we had a major break in last night and there has been a significant amount of damage to our equipment. All of our kit and computers have been destroyed, and the samples have been taken. Luckily, we still have back ups of the data, so at least that is safe. 

The good news is that the culprits have been caught - they were working with a pro-life group who objected to the experiment on religious grounds. 

The first thing we need to do is re-build which is going to cost us £5m, but we also need to decide how we want to engage with the culprit. We can prosecute them and try to recoup our money through the courts - or we can engage the group in conversation and maybe develop a new public engagement project. This might help them and similar groups understand more about stem cell research and future proof our experiments. The latter is a bold move, but it might decrease our harm, as it raises public awareness of the issues surrounding our research.

Let me know what you think

Engage Protestors 

JC: I will start the process. I think that this is the best solution to this problem

It is intended this will use a small sample size and I am fully confident in my team’s ability to further progress our research. A decision must be made as to which organism will be selected for testing - Pigs, Mice or Fish. Each have their own merits and I would encourage you to once again pursue a results driven approach for the benefit of progress. 

As we only need a small sample size it will only cost us £1,000,000 and the harm rating will be lower than usual 

I await your response.
